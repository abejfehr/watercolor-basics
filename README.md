# Watercolor Basics ðŸŽ¨ðŸ’¦

Basic tips for developing an everyday open-ended watercolor practice. For expressive observational painting more than rigid illustration. Mostly lessons learned from 10+ years learning, teaching and making art in a variety of mediums.

## Paints

<!-- This really should be all you need until you want to move up in scale. It doesn't suite every painting style though so just know buying water color paints in tubes is an option also. I just never personally saw students or professionals have much use for them unless they decided to work with guache, which is in the same family as standard watercolors but completely different in terms of style, technique etc. -->

* keep it simple
* buy brick sets, not tubes
* more money only helps up to ~$30
* check the pigments on the paint bricks
* if they list actual pigments its good enough
* all light chalky colored paint bricks is a deal breaker
* [just buy this](https://www.amazon.com/Winsor-Newton-Cotman-Colour-Compact/dp/B00004THXH/ref=sr_1_6?keywords=winsor+and+newton+watercolor+paint&qid=1655241652&sprefix=winsor%2Caps%2C234&sr=8-6)

## Brushes

<!-- The best advice I ever got from teachers or gave to students was to keep it simple. Go to the bargain bin / sale section and pick brushes out intuitively.  -->

<!-- If you get a good feeling from it for any reason and it's cheap, go for it. Like you're picking out a magic wand (for harry potter nerds) or a lightsaber (for star wars nerds even though that doesn't make sense). I researched and experimented with a lot of different brush purchasing and maintenance systems and ended up coming back to this much simpler way of doing things over and over again.  -->

* brushes are all doomed
* buy them on sale, follow your gut, no rules
* like magic wands / lightsabers (for the nerds)
* don't worry about natural vs. synthetic hair
* keep the plastic tubes
* rinse, wring out and re-shape often
* a medium round is all you need
* 3-5 sized flats help
* don't leave them in water ever
* when they lose their shape keep them for scumbling (rough painting)
* when they still keep their shape be gentle with them

## Paper

<!-- Anything labelled watercolor paper is generally fine. Same rules as brushes more or less, get what's on sale / cheap, open it up, feel the paper, trust your gut, trial and error, you'll know what you want better with time. -->

<!-- Specifics on paper really don't matter too much in my experience as long the paper you're using is fairly thick. There are a buch of confusing types though so here are the general options. All of these work fine. -->

* get what's on sale / cheap
* open it up, feel the paper
* trust your gut
* trial and error
* Hot Press (smooth surface)
* Cold Press (rough surface)
* Watercolor Blocks (you use it one sheet at a time, prevents paper warping a little)
* Loose Sheets (this is a super normal way to buy fancy paper, I usually tear it into sections with a ruler rather than scissors to keep a rough natural edge)
* Rag Paper (fancy, 100% cotton, fun but not actually that noticable imo)
* Paper Weight (in lbs or gsm usually, 90+ lbs is a good rule of thumb, if it feels thick enough it generally is though)


## Other Materials

<!-- Some other stuff I suggest you pick up. The blotter paper (or paper towel, ripped pieces of water color paper etc) is important for making pressing against wet sections of your paintings to make negative marks and dry out overly-wet paper. -->

* squeezable water bottle
* dixie / condiment cups (for water) 
* blotter paper / paper towel / ripped pieces of watercolor paper (for negative marks / drying out overly wet paper)


## Painting

* paint shapes not lines
* areas of shadow and light
* don't worry too much about shape & location of shapes
* zoom WAY in on subjects
* draw a box in pencil
* force shapes / objects to fall off edge
* no un-broken edges
* use chromatic black (start with dark brown and dark blue)
* dont use color at first (just chromatic black)
* don't let yourself think about objects / people / things
* just abstract shapes of light and shadow
* let your palette and paint bricks get dirty
* dirty watercolors make natural colors
* clean them with paper towels and water occaisionally
* add details after all this if desired
