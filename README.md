# Watercolor Basics?

Basic tips for developing an everyday open-ended watercolor practice. For expressive observational painting more than rigid illustration. Mostly wisdom picked up from 10+ years learning, teaching and making art for some reason.

## Paints

<!-- This really should be all you need until you want to move up in scale. It doesn't suite every painting style though so just know buying water color paints in tubes is an option also. I just never personally saw students or professionals have much use for them unless they decided to work with guache, which is in the same family as standard watercolors but completely different in terms of style, technique etc. -->

* keep it simple
* buy brick sets, not tubes
* more money only helps up to ~$30
* check the pigments on the paint bricks
* if they list actual pigments its good enough
* all light chalky colored paint bricks is a deal breaker
* [just buy this](https://www.amazon.com/Winsor-Newton-Cotman-Colour-Compact/dp/B00004THXH/ref=sr_1_6?keywords=winsor+and+newton+watercolor+paint&qid=1655241652&sprefix=winsor%2Caps%2C234&sr=8-6)

## Brushes

<!-- The best advice I ever got from teachers or gave to students was to keep it simple. Go to the bargain bin / sale section and pick brushes out intuitively.  -->

<!-- If you get a good feeling from it for any reason and it's cheap, go for it. Like you're picking out a magic wand (for harry potter nerds) or a lightsaber (for star wars nerds even though that doesn't make sense). I researched and experimented with a lot of different brush purchasing and maintenance systems and ended up coming back to this much simpler way of doing things over and over again.  -->

* brushes are all doomed
* buy them on sale, follow your gut, no rules
* like magic wands / lightsabers maybe
* natural vs. synthetic hair doesn't matter
* keep plastic tubes if brushes have them
* rinse, wring out and re-shape often
* reshape gently when cleaed out and moist
* aim for original shape of brush
* a medium round (the pointy but wide-ish one) is all you need
* 3-5 sized flats (the flat square ones) help
* don't leave them in water ever (ever)
* when they lose their shape keep them for scumbling (rough painting)
* when they still keep their shape be gentle with them

## Paper

<!-- Anything labelled watercolor paper is generally fine. Same rules as brushes more or less, get what's on sale / cheap, open it up, feel the paper, trust your gut, trial and error, you'll know what you want better with time. -->

<!-- Specifics on paper really don't matter too much in my experience as long the paper you're using is fairly thick. There are a buch of confusing types though so here are the general options. All of these work fine. -->

* get what's on sale / cheap
* open it up, feel the paper
* medium heavy is good enough
* postcard to printer paper sizes are good
* trust your gut / trial and error
* hot press means smooth surface
* cold press means rough surface
* they're both fine / go with your gut
* watercolor blocks you use one sheet at a time
* prevents paper warping a little
* old school / fun / unecessary
* loose sheets are fancier
* tear them into sections with ruler to keep nice edge
* rag paper means fancy 100% cotton
* old school / fun / unecessary / unnoticeable
* paper weight is in lbs or gsm usually
* 90+ lbs is a good rule of thumb
* if it feels thick enough it is


## Other Materials

<!-- Some other stuff I suggest you pick up. The blotter paper (or paper towel, ripped pieces of water color paper etc) is important for making pressing against wet sections of your paintings to make negative marks and dry out overly-wet paper. -->

* squeezable water bottle / with plastic nipple thing
* dixie / condiment cups for water
* blotter paper / paper towel / ripped pieces of thick paper
* for negative marks / drying out overly wet paper


## Painting

* paint shapes not lines
* abstract shapes / areas of shadow and light
* don't fixate on size & location of shapes
* zoom WAY in on subjects
* draw a box with pencil / ruler to paint in
* force shapes / objects to fall off edge / zoom in
* no un-broken edges
* use chromatic black / mix dark brown and dark blue
* any dark complimentary colors can work
* dont use color at first / just chromatic black
* don't let yourself think about objects / people / things
* turn off brain / eyes and hands only
* just abstract shapes of light and shadow
* let your palette and paint bricks get dirty
* dirty watercolors make natural colors
* clean them with paper towels and water occaisionally
* add details / color after all this if desired
* erase dried paint by re-wetting / using blotter paper
